ğŸ§  What's Going On
- int i; declares a global variable i, but it is not initialized, so it contains a garbage value.
- In C++, global variables are zero-initialized by default, so i is set to 0.
- When std::cout << i << " enter the number" runs, it prints the current value of i (which is 0) followed by the prompt.

in if condition the second line after if statment print statment always execute

(e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
